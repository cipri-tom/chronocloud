# Abstract

In this project we present an exploratory analysis of the Google books corpus
over English, French, Spanish and German. The aim of this work is to model and
quantify linguistic drift using word resilience and kernel distance. We also look
at word birth and death rates and resilience spectra. Our results indicate that the
studied languages have slowed down in more recent years and, with the exception
of important events like the world wars, they follow the same evolution model.
